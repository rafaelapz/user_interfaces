#Usage

    Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a login dialog. Enter the correct username and password to access the rest of the application.
    For testing purposes, username-password combinations that currently work in the (Username, Password)format are:
        (admin, admin)
        ("janedoe", "password2")
        ("johndoe", "password1")
    A proper sign-up and login system is planned as a future feature.

    Once logged in, you will see the home page with a video player and control buttons to play, pause, and browse through videos - to either go to the previous or next video. There's also a navigation bar at the top of the window, which allows you to switch between different pages.
