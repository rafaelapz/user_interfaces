C++ compiler (g++ or clang)

# Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.<br>
2. Open the project in Qt Creator. <br>
3. In the run configuration, write the path to the videos folder in quotes. for example "C://user_interfaces_project/videos". <br>
4. Build and run the project. <br>

# Usage

Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a login dialog. Enter the correct username and password to access the rest of the application.
For testing purposes, username-password combinations that currently work in the (Username, Password)format are:
        (admin, admin)
        ("janedoe", "password2")
        ("johndoe", "password1")
A proper sign-up and login system is planned as a future feature.

Once logged in, you will see the home page with a video player and control buttons to play, pause, and browse through videos - to either go to the previous or next video. There's also a navigation bar at the top of the window, which allows you to switch between different pages.
